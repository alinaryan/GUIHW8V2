 This assignment features a one line scrabble board game.

 The features that currently work are the drag and drop capabilities from
 the rack div to the board div. The page also features a jumbotron with a
 title and game instructions. There are also two styled buttons under the game,
 a submit and reset button. Submit is used to submit a word and reset is used
 to reset the game.

Currently, when a user drags a letter to the board, the individual tile slots
disappear and only one letter is able to placed at a time.

In the future, I would fix the above error and I would add a place that keeps
a score and tells the user how many tiles are left. I would also finish the
algorithm that tacks all the letter tiles and randomizes them for the user.
